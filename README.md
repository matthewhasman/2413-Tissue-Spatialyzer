# 2413-Tissue-Spatialyzer

The Tissue Spatialyzer project is an integrated system designed to sample tissue with high precision and bring them onto a microwell plate. This repository includes all the software necessary for actuating the microfluidic hardware and gantry stages. 

Run launch.py to use an integrated GUI to control the Tissue Spatialyzer system. 
Run main.py to run individual scripts controlling Fluigent and Zaber controllers.
